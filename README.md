# NMF
Non-negative Matrix Factorization is a Linear-algeabreic model, that factors high-dimensional vectors into a low-dimensionality representation. Similar to Principal component analysis (PCA), NMF takes advantage of the fact that the vectors are non-negative. By factoring them into the lower-dimensional form, NMF forces the coefficients to also be non-negative.
